--- Differs from Hazel in that:


I changed IndexBuffer in OpenGL to be bound to the 'GL_ARRAY_BUFFER' target instead of 'GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER'. (Aug. 27, 2019)

I did not update .gitmodules (git submodules) from this commit:
https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/commit/52ff54ca80ff426e42176482444b2874280c0ad6

My shaders are parsed with my own code.

My 2D standard shader does not branch for different textures.
(see https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/commit/18abce3c28db4e8384ad21cf64b6d36bee003215)

And more.
